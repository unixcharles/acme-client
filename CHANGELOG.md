## `0.5.2`

* Fix acme error names
* ASN1 parsing improvements

## `0.5.1`

* Set serial number of self-signed certificate

## `0.5.0`

* Allow access to `Acme::Client#endpoint` and `Acme::Client#directory_uri`
* Add `Acme::Client#fetch_authorization`
* Setup cyclic dependency between challenges and their authorization for easier access of either with the other.
* Drop `Acme::Client#challenge_from_hash` and `Acme::Client::Resources::Challenges::Base#to_h` in favor of the new API.
* Delegate `Acme::Client::Resources::Challenges::Base#verify_status` to `Acme::Client::Resources::Authorization#verify_status` and make it update existing challenge objects. This makes it so that whichever is called, the correct status is reflected everywhere.
* Add `Authorization#verify_status` - Recent versions of boulder will no longer process a challenge if the associated authorization is already valid, that is another challenge was previously solved. This means we need to allow people to poll on the authorizations status rather than the challenge status so they don't have to poll on the status of all challenges of an authorization all the time.

* Drop ActiveSupport dependency

## `0.3.7`

* Simplify internal `require` statements
* Fix usage of json-jwt return value
* Remove usage of deprecated `qualified_const_defined?`
* Add user agent to upstream calls
* Fix gem requiring
* Set CSR version

## `0.3.6`

* Handle non-json errors better

## `0.3.5`

* Handle non protocol related server error

## `0.3.4`

* Make `Acme::Client#challenge_from_hash` more strict with the arguments it receives
